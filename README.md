## Architecture

## Pros & Cons

- Remote

  - We can cache downloaded NPM modules to bundle code faster
  - Will work better for users with slow devices or limited internet connections

- Local

  - Removes an extra request to the API server - faster code execution
  - We don't have to maintain an API server
  - Less complexity - no moving code back and forth
